Analysis
-Cities on or very close to the equator did not experience the highest temperatures, although high temperatures were more consistent in that area and there was slightly less variability. The highest temperatures where instead experienced closer to the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, located at 23.5 and -23.5 degrees latitude respectively. This phenomenon and variability may be due to the differences in the number of cities that fall along these latitudes as well as the geographic features. The highest temperatures were experienced between latitudes of -30 and 30 degrees, although with generally more variability as you increase distance from 0 degrees latitude. Using the average temperature parameter, we can see more consistency between -20 and 20 degrees latitude.
-Humidity doesn't seem to have much correlation to latitude. Several varying latitudes have % humidity ranging from 40 to 100%. However, based on this small data sampling, humidity does experience variation as we approach the Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn with some falling below 40% humidity. The cities on the equator experienced the 40% to 100% range.
THere is no significant correlation between latitude and cloud cover or wind speed. Frequency of wind speed, however, can be observed. The most common observation was speeds between 0 and 10 mph. Observations decrease in frequency as you increase wind speed with rare occurrences of wind speeds greater than 30 mph.
