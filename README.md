Analysis

1. Cities that are very close to the equator experience high temperatures were more consistent with less variability. The highest temperatures however were experienced closer to the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, located at 23.5 and -23.5 degrees latitude respectively. This may be due to the differences in the number of cities that fall along these latitudes as well as the geographic features. The highest temperatures were experienced between latitudes of -30 and 30 degrees.

2. Humidity doesn't seem to have much correlation to latitude. The warmer the temperatures are the more humid the cities are. Several varying latitudes have % humidity ranging from 40 to 100%. However, based on this small data sampling, humidity does experience variation as we approach the Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn with some falling below 40% humidity. The cities on the equator experienced the 40% to 100% range.

3. There is no significant correlation between latitude and cloud cover or wind speed. Latitude has direct affect on the temperatures and not so much on humidity, cloudiness and windspeed directly.
